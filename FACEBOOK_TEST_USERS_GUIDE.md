## 📱 **Instructions for Test Users**

```
Hi! I'm working on a social media analytics project for school. 

Could you help test my app? Here's what you need to do:

1. Accept the Facebook app invitation (you'll get a notification)
2. Visit: https://your-app.netlify.app
3. Click "Continue with Facebook" 
4. Grant the requested permissions
5. You'll see analytics for your Facebook pages!

The app shows real data from your Facebook pages - engagement, reach, top posts, etc. It's completely safe and only reads public data.

Thanks for helping with my project! 🙏

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

### **Test User Limitations:**
- ⚠️ **Maximum 25 test users** (Facebook restriction)
- ⚠️ **Must accept invitation** to use app
- ⚠️ **Need Facebook pages** for full analytics

### **After Facebook App Review:**
- ✅ **Unlimited users** worldwide
- ✅ **No invitations required**
- ✅ **Any Facebook user** can use your app

### **Your App is Production-Ready:**
The 25-user limit is a Facebook policy for apps in development mode, not a technical limitation of your app. Your code works perfectly for unlimited users once approved!
